Usage:
  write-env [options] [overrides]

Creates an environment variables file (.env)
from defined and supplied settings.

Write-Env accepts these optional settings.


Options:

  -c --create                       Allows you to pass additional key value
                                    pairs that will be added to the file
                                    and will override matching defaults.

  -d=<path> --destination=<path>    Sets the destination path to write the
                                    environment data.

  -e=<type> --environment=<type>    Changes variable defaults to the
                                    environment supplied. This changes
                                    the output printed as well as the
                                    file created.
                                    NOTE: changing the environment will
                                    change the name of the file created.
                                    The name will be .env.[environment_name]

  -f --force                        Overwrites existing .env files without
                                    prompting.

  -h --help                         Print this very copy you're reading
                                    right now to the console.

  -p --print                        Outputs environment variables
                                    settings to the console.

  -s=<path> --source=<path>         Sets the source file to read data from.
                                    The default is package.json.




Overrides:

Any overrides supplied take precedence over defaults. Overrides are in the format NAME=value.

Example:

write-env
write-env -c

write-env -e=develop
write-env -c -e=develop
